# GraphDB_Langchain
This project demonstrates how to build a question-answering application over a Neo4j movie database using LangChain and Groq. The application allows users to ask natural language questions about movies, actors, directors, and genres, and the system translates these questions into Cypher queries to retrieve information from the Neo4j graph database.
